('LOC_YT_LEARN_FROM_OTHER_CIVS_EXPLANATION', '[COLOR_RED]====== [from the mod "DB [ICON_Science]Yield Tweaks[ICON_Culture] - Learn From Other Civs game option"] ======[ENDCOLOR][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Your civilization''s science/culture output gets a bonus when you are researching a tech/civic that you''ve seen in another civilization. Consider: the most helpful knowledge for researching something like, say, nuclear fission or democracy, would be knowing that it exists and seeing it in action somewhere in the world. Compare that to researching alchemy (trying to turn lead into gold), which was heavily studied in medieval times but all those experiments were in vain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here''s how it works... For each civ that has the tech/civic you are researching, you get a bonus based on how friendly you are with that nation. In other words, you would learn about gunpowder faster from a friend than you would from an enemy, and faster yet from a scientific research ally. The lowest bonus you could have from another civ is +40% (i.e. if you''ve only just met them, or you''re at war), and the highest is +200% (i.e. if you have a Level 3 Research Alliance and Top Secret diplomatic visibility).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Now if you see a technology in multiple nations, you do get a bonus from each, but there are diminishing returns. You get your bonus in full from your closest friend, but for each civ after that, the bonus is halved. This is because it is assumed that about half of what you learn about gunpowder from your second best friend is redundant with what you already knew from your best friend. Then we move to the civ with the third highest bonus and it is halved again (i.e. +1% becomes +0.25%), and so on for every other civilization that we''ve met that has the thing we''re researching. Therefore, the biggest bonuses come from your one or two best friends, and the rest are just table scraps. Your scientists aren''t really learning anything new from North Korea''s implementation of rocketry; although if it was the world''s only successful implementation of rocketry, they''d learn quite a bit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_Blue]LIST OF BONUSES[ENDCOLOR][NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Met Civilization +40%[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Diplomatic Visibility: Limited +15%[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Diplomatic Visibility: Open +30%[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Diplomatic Visibility: Secret +45%[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Diplomatic Visibility: Top Secret +60%[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Alliance Level 1 +30%[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Alliance Level 2 +40%[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Alliance Level 3 +50%[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Research Alliance Level 1 +60% for technologies, +30% for civics[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Research Alliance Level 2 +80% for technologies, +40% for civics[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Research Alliance Level 3 +100% for technologies, +50% for civics[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Cultural Alliance Level 1 +60% for civics, +30% for technologies[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Cultural Alliance Level 2 +80% for civics, +40% for technologies[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Cultural Alliance Level 3 +100% for civics, +50% for technologies[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Declared Friend +10% (when not in an alliance)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Open Borders in their territory +10% (when not in an alliance)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Defensive Pact +10% (when not in an alliance)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]In a Joint War together +10% (when not in an alliance)' , 'en_US'),
